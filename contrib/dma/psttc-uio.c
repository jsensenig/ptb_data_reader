/* 
 * PS TTC UIO User Space Driver Example
 *
 * The purpose of this user space driver is to illustrate using the UIO driver framework.
 * This used together with the UIO uio_pdrv_genirq device driver in the kernel. The device
 * tree node for the TTC must have "generic-uio" in the compatible list. 
 *
 * The uio_pdrv_genirq driver is a platform driver that also uses the device tree. For any
 * device tree nodes with "generic-uio" in the compatibility list, it will create a device
 * node, /dev/uioX, where X = 0, 1, 2... and then process the memory range and the interrupt
 * properties in the node. This will allow a user space driver to access the device memory 
 * and be notified of device interrupts.
 * 
 * No kernel space driver is required for this UIO user space driver.
 *
 * This application controls the PS TTC to enable the timer interrupt, start the timer,
 * and then handle the interrupt caused by the timer. The interrupt from the TTC is 
 * handled as an interrupt by the UIO kernel driver and then communicated to the user 
 * space application via the UIO file node.
